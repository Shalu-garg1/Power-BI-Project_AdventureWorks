### Power BI Sales Report for a company producing cycling equipment and accessories

This is a Power BI sales report built using the AdventureWorks dataset, a freely available sample database for business analysis. The project involves key steps such as data cleaning and manipulation using Power Query, building a robust data model, calculating columns and measures using DAX, and creating interactive dashboards to deliver insightful business intelligence for the company management.

The primary dashboard highlights crucial KPIs including revenue, total orders, profit and return rate, providing a snapshot of the company's overall performance. Additionally, the report includes various charts providing the following insights:

-Weekly revenue trends

-Top 10 products by sales

-Most ordered product and most returned product

-Category-wise order distribution

-Sales region representation using an interactive map

In addition to the main dashboard, separate dashboards offer detailed information about product-wise and customer-wise performance. Advanced Power BI features like bookmarks, drill-through, and parameters have been incorporated to provide deeper insights and enhance user interactivity, enabling users to navigate the report with ease and gain detailed, personalized analysis.

This report serves as a comprehensive tool to analyze sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve business outcomes.
